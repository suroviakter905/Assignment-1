        <p align="justify">
            <b>Demetria Devonne Lovato,</b> (born August 20, 1992) is an American singer, songwriter, and actor. After appearing on the children's television series
            <b>Barney & Friends</b> (2002-2004), Lovato rose to prominence for playing Mitchie Torres in the musical television film <b>Camp Rock</b>(2008) and its 
            sequel <b>Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam</b>(2010); the former film's soundtrack contained <b>"This Is Me"</b>Lovato's debut single and duet with 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Jonas" target="_blank">Joe Jonas,</a>which peaked at number nine on the <b>Billboard Hot 100.</b>

            After signing with <b>Hollywood Records,</b> Lovato released their <b>pop rock</b> debut album, <b>Don't Forget</b> (2008), which debuted at number two on the <b>Billboard 200.</b>
            Its follow-up, <b>Here We Go Again</b> (2009), debuted at number one in the U.S., while its <b>title track</b> reached number 15 on the Hot 100. Lovato's third studio album,
            <b>Unbroken</b> (2011), experimented with pop and <b>R&B</b> and spawned the U.S. <b>platinum-certified</b> single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyscraper_(song)" target="_blank">"Skyscraper"</a> . They released their eponymous <b>fourth album</b> in 2013,
            which debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, and contained the top-ten international hit <b>"Heart Attack"</b>. Lovato's fifth and sixth albums, <b>Confident</b> (2015)
            and <b>Tell Me You Love Me</b> (2017), infused soul and mature themes; they earned a <b>Grammy Award</b> nomination for Confident, while <b>"Sorry Not Sorry"</b>, the lead single
            from Tell Me You Love Me, became their highest-charting single in the U.S., reaching number six. After a hiatus, Lovato released their seventh album,
            <b>Dancing with the Devil... the Art of Starting Over</b> (2021), which reached number two on the Billboard 200.

            activist for several social causes, Lovato's struggles with an eating disorder and substance abuse have received considerable media attention, in response to

        <h1>Early life and career beginnings</h1>
        <p align="justify">
            <b>Demetria Devonne Lovato</b> was born on August 20, 1992, in <b>Albuquerque, New Mexico,</b> <sup>[7]</sup> to former Dallas Cowboys cheerleader <b>Dianna De La Garza<b> (née Lee Smith) <sup>[8]</sup> and engineer and musician
            <b>Patrick Martin Lovato.</b> <sup>[9]</sup> Lovato has an older full sister named </b>Dallas</b>; <sup>[10]</sup> a younger maternal half-sister, actress Madison De La Garza; <sup>[11]</sup> and an older paternal half-sister, Amber, 
            whom they first spoke to when they were twenty years old.<sup>[12]</sup>
        </p>

        <p align="justify"><i>
            In mid-1994, shortly after Lovato's second birthday, their parents divorced.<sup>[13]</sup> Their father was of Mexican descent, with mostly Spanish and Native American ancestors, and came from a family that had been 
            living in New Mexico for generations; he also had distant Portuguese and Jewish ancestry.<sup>[14]</sup><sup>[15]</sup> Their mother is of English and Irish descent.<sup>[16]</sup><sup>[17]</sup> Patrick was a descendant of Civil War Union veteran 
            Francisco Perea and Santa Fe de Nuevo México governor Francisco Xavier Chávez.<sup>[18]</sup> Lovato had no interest in forging a relationship with Patrick after their parents divorced.<sup>[19]</sup> They have been vocal about 
            their abusive and strained relationship with him and once stated, "He was mean, but he wanted to be a good person. And he wanted to have his family, and when my mom married my stepdad, he still had this huge 
            heart where he said, 'I'm so glad that [he's] taking care of you and doing the job that I wish I could do'."<sup>[20]</sup><sup>[21]</sup> After Patrick died of cancer on June 22, 2013,<sup>[22]</sup> Lovato said that he had been mentally ill, 
            and they created the Lovato Treatment Scholarship Program in his honor.<sup>[23]</sup>
        </i></p>

        <p align="justify"><b>
            Lovato was brought up in Dallas, Texas.<sup>[24]</sup><sup>[25]</sup> They began playing the piano at age seven and guitar at ten,<sup>[26]</sup> when they began dancing and acting classes.<sup>[27]</sup> In 2002, Lovato began their acting career on the 
            children's television series Barney & Friends, portraying the role of Angela.<sup>[28]</sup> They appeared on Prison Break in 2006 and on Just Jordan the following year.<sup>[7]</sup> Due to their acting career, Lovato was bullied 
            and consequently requested homeschooling,<sup>[29]</sup> through which they eventually received their high-school diploma.<sup>[30]</sup>

        <h1><u>Personal Life:</u></h1>
        <h2>Residence</h2>
            <p align="justify">
                On August 20, 2010, their 18th birthday, Lovato purchased a Mediterranean-style house in Los Angeles for their family; however, Lovato decided to live in a "sober house" in Los Angeles after leaving rehab in January 2011. In September 2016, 
                Lovato also purchased a Laurel Canyon home in Los Angeles for $8.3 million, which they sold in June 2020 for $8.25 million. In September 2020, Lovato purchased a Studio City home in Los Angeles for $7 million.
            </p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>  
            <p align="justify">
                Lovato started training in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, a martial art derived from jujutsu, in 2016. They are ranked as a blue belt as of 2019.
            </p>

        <h2>Mental health and substance abuse</h2>  
            <p align="justify"><i>
                Lovato had suffered from bulimia nervosa, self-harm, and being bullied before their first stint in rehab at age 18. On November 1, 2010, Lovato withdrew from the Jonas Brothers: Live in Concert tour, entering a treatment facility for 
                "physical and emotional issues". It was reported[285] that they decided to enter treatment after punching backup dancer Alex Welch; their family and management team convinced them they needed help. Lovato said they took "100 percent, full 
                responsibility" for the incident. On January 28, 2011, they completed in-patient treatment at Timberline Knolls and returned home. Lovato acknowledged that they had bulimia, had cut themself, and had been "self-medicating" with drugs and 
                alcohol "like a lot of teens do to numb their pain". They added that they "basically had a nervous breakdown" and had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder during their treatment. They later admitted to having used cocaine several times 
                a day and smuggled cocaine onto airplanes.
            </i></p>

        <h2>2018 drug overdose</h2> 
            <p align="justify"><b>
                On June 21, 2018, Lovato released the single "Sober" in which they revealed they had relapsed after six years of sobriety. On July 24, 2018, they were rushed to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles after emergency services 
                were called to their home due to an opioid overdose. Lovato recalled, "The doctors told me that I had five to 10 minutes, like, if no one had found me, then I wouldn't be here. The singer was reported to be stable and recovering 
                later in the day. They reportedly overdosed on oxycodone laced with fentanyl[307] and were revived with naloxone. Lovato also had multiple health complications stemming from the overdose, including multiple strokes, a heart attack, 
                and brain damage, the latter of which caused lasting vision problems. They were hospitalized for two weeks and subsequently entered an in-patient rehab facility.
