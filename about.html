    <h2>Activism and philanthropy</h2>
    <p align="justify">
        Lovato's work as an LGBT rights activist has been recognized by GLAAD, which awarded them the Vanguard Award in 2016. 
        When the Defense of Marriage Act was appealed in June 2013, Lovato celebrated the occasion on social media. 
        Lovato has previously affirmed their support for the LGBT community: "I believe in gay marriage, I believe in equality. 
        I think there's a lot of hypocrisy with religion. But I just found that you can have your own relationship with God, 
        and I still have a lot of faith. In May 2014, Lovato was named lead performer for NYC Pride Week and Grand Marshal 
        of the LA Pride Parade, where they later filmed the music video for "Really Don't Care".

    <p align="justify"><b>
        Lovato has also raised awareness for health and mental health issues. For their efforts to fight mental health stigma, 
        they were honored with the Artistic Award of Courage by The Jane and Terry Semel Institute. In May 2009, Lovato was 
        named an Honorary Ambassador of Education by the American Partnership For Eosinophilic Disorders.[327] In December 2011, 
        Lovato condemned the Disney Channel for airing episodes of Shake It Up and So Random! in which characters joked about 
        eating disorders. The network subsequently issued an apology and removed the episodes from their broadcast and video on demand services.

    <p align="justify"><i>
        Lovato is a vocal anti-bullying advocate. In October 2010, they served as spokesperson for the anti-bullying organization PACER and 
        appeared on America's Next Top Model to speak out against bullying. Lovato participated in the "A Day Made Better" school advocacy 
        campaign and has supported DonateMyDress.org
